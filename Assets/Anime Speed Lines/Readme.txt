The animation is created using a single texture sheet that contains a sequence of 22 bitmap frames. The frames are stretched horizontally to create a full screen effect. The colour is applied using a bitmap gradient.


HOW TO USE:

1. Determine what texture size is appropriate for your scene. There are three texture sizes in the package (512x512, 1024x1024 and 2048x2048). There are example scenes provided for various screen resolutions.

2. Drag the prefab onto the Hierarchy and scale to fit the camera view.

3. The prefabs are made at a 4:3 aspect ratio but they can be stretched to fit a wider screen size by increasing the x scale value.

4. By default the direction of the lines goes from right to left. To make the lines go left to right, give the x scale a negative value.

5. To make the lines go up or down, give the z rotation a value of 90 and adjust the x and y scale accordingly.

6. To change the colour, expand the prefab in the Hierarchy and select "Gradient". In the Inspector, select the Sprite picker and choose a different gradient from the list of textures. Be sure to pick a gradient with the same texture resolution.

7. To create a new colour, edit the "Gradients" psd located in Sprites folder.
